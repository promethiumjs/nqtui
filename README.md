# NQTUI

_JavaScript UI library built on top of [lit-html](https://lit.dev/docs/libraries/standalone-templates/)_

Nqtui aims to be a powerful and expressive JavaScript UI library built on top of [lit-html](https://lit.dev/docs/libraries/standalone-templates/)
that enables complex web app development using lightweight stateful components as building blocks. Its a quite performant alternative to other 
libraries and frameworks that mainly involves developing in *just* JavaScript and CSS with no default build step aside from module bundling and 
other forms of code processing powered by [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). This makes it quite extensible and able to accomodate different workflows 
involving a wide range of filetypes.

Nqtui is however undergoing a substantial API redesign and is not recommended for use in projects. The redesign shouldn't take long it is 
relatively active development. For the meantime, feel free to take a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/promethiumjs/nqtui/wiki) 
which is also currently being worked on, or skim through the codebase if that interests you.
